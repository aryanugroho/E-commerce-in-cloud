To build project first get latest source code using GIT

git clone https://github.com/kurochenko/E-commerce-in-cloud.git

in /src/main/resources/spring/persistence-config.xml change connection to database

then build project using maven2 command called from project root folder (pom.xml is there)

mvn install

Now you can run project on any servlet container e.g. Tomcat or in CLoudFoundry cloud. For that create an application in the cloud. From ./target directory of projects root folder run vmc commands
vmc push

Application uses approximately 300 MB of RAM. So assign at least 512 MB and connect PostgreSQL service.
